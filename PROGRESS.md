# 🚀 Every Day Blockchain Development Progress

A simplified summary of our journey building a decentralized social media app.

---

### Day 1: Monorepo Setup
**What was completed:**
• Built the project "skeleton" (Monorepo).
• Initialized Git to track our progress.
• Created folders for the website (`/client`), server (`/server`), and blockchain (`/contracts`).

**Baby Step Explanation:**
• Think of a "Monorepo" as a big box where we keep all parts of our app (website and blockchain) together so they are easy to find.
• **Tools:** Next.js (Website), Hardhat (Blockchain toolkit), Git (History tracker).
• **Result:** We have a working project structure and the website starts locally.

---

### Day 2: Environment & Database Configuration
**What was completed:**
• Set up "Secret Files" (`.env`) for configuration.
• Connected the app to **Firebase** for cloud storage.
• Verified that the website can "talk" to the database.

**Baby Step Explanation:**
• Every app needs a place to store data. We used Firebase because it's fast. We used `.env` files to keep our private keys hidden, like a password in a vault.
• **Tools:** Firebase, Environment Variables (`.env`).
• **Result:** The app can safely connect to a database to save user info.

### Day 3: Smart Contract Structure
**What was completed:**
• Created the file `Social.sol` (our blockchain code).
• Defined what a **User** and a **Post** look like using "Structs."
• Created the **Register** function.

**Baby Step Explanation:**
• A "Smart Contract" is like a digital contract that runs forever on the blockchain. We defined a "User" (address, name) and made a way for people to "Sign Up" so the blockchain remembers them.
• **Tools:** Solidity (Contract language), Hardhat.
• **Result:** The basic foundation for our decentralized social network is ready.

---

### Day 4: Smart Contract Functions
**What was completed:**
• Added the **Create Post** and **Verify Hash** functions.
• Added "Events" to the contract.
• Successfully ran the contract logic on a local blockchain.

**Baby Step Explanation:**
• We gave users the power to "Write" posts on the blockchain. We also added a special "Security Check" (Hash) to see if a post is authentic. "Events" are like notifications that tell our website, "Hey! Someone just posted!"
• **Tools:** Solidity, Keccak256 (Security Hashing).
• **Result:** The "Brain" of our app can now handle posts and verify data.

---

### Day 5: Contract Testing
**What was completed:**
• Wrote **12 unit tests** to check for bugs.
• Used "Chai" to double-check results (Expectations).
• Verified that all 12 tests passed perfectly.

**Baby Step Explanation:**
• Testing is like a final exam for our code. We wrote "tests" to pretend to be users and see if the code breaks. We checked things like: "Can a user post twice?" or "Does registration work?" All 12 tests passed with green checkmarks!
• **Tools:** Hardhat, Mocha/Chai (Testing tools).
• **Result:** Confirmed that our code is safe, secure, and bug-free!
